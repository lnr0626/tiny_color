# TinyColor

An elixir port of the (`@ctrl/tinycolor`)[https://github.com/typectrl/tinycolor#readme] typescript port of the original (`tinycolor2`)[https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor] by (Brian Grinstead)[https://github.com/bgrins]. It's ports all the way down....

This library would not be possible without the work from either of those two libraries.

Inspiration also came from (`css_colors`)[https://github.com/alvinlindstam/css_colors]. It doesn't have the breadth of support that I needed for my use case, but provided a good foundation for ideas on structuring an elixir color library.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tiny_color` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tiny_color, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tiny_color](https://hexdocs.pm/tiny_color).
